# 1000 Genome Project Variant Imputed Results

## Motivation
I was tryting to obatin pairwise Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) using emeraLD, a recently devloped rapid estimation for massive dataset. However, when I tested with the original variants file from 1000 Genome Project, emeraLD failed because the file contained missing genotype. It recommended me to use minimac4, a fast genotype imputation software. This process can be quite time consuming, so I ended up googling imputed results of 1000 Genome Project by other people. To my superise, despite everyone uses 1000 Genome Project and various imputation software available (and I am sure many, many people have done this for their own study), I have not found a single place that allows me to just download the imputed results. So after spending a fair amount of time with emeraLD, I think it is worthwhile to share my results.
